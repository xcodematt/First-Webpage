This is the first webpage that I have made alone from scratch after about
a month of learning coding. This is a project made for the Odin Project course,
slightly changed to be responsive, following Kevin Powell's Scrimba responsive
design course. The pictures don't look perfect on certain screen sizes
as the pictures that I have found were not centered.
